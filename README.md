## Introduction

\#see.ss is an online CSS visualizer. I spend a lot of time fiddling with CSS, going back and forth between the code and the visuals. I created this app to view my CSS code and my CSS code's visual representation in real-time. The user can input text, change the text's color, change the background color, and see the CSS code simultaneously.
